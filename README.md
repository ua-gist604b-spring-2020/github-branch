# Assignment: GitHub Branch and Merge
## Worth: 20 points
## Due: 7 days

## Background
Read:
- [Protected Branches](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches)
- [Pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

This Repo was created with a single, `master` branch, which is protected, meaning you can't commit changes to it. In the
software development world, maintainers typically maintain a `master` branch and create alternative branches which can
contain new features, bug fixes, etc. that need to be tested extensively before being merged back into the `master` branch.
In larger software projects there are extensive tests and tooling set up to automatically test branches to see if they
can be safely merged into master and only after passing these tests AND after review by a Maintainer of the project
can the changes be adopted into `master`.

## Directions

1. (5 pts) Your assignment is to create a new branch named `my-branch` and in that branch, modify this document by entering your 
branch name below:

The name of my branch is: My-Branch

2. (5 pts) When you have created your branch with this file modified above, create a *Pull Request* to merge your new branch into `master`.
Be sure to give a description so that the *Reviewer* knows what you are creating, fixing, deleting, or improving. When you submit 
your Pull Request you will see that a Review is required and that Merging is blocked.

3. (5 pts) Once you have created your *Pull Request*, I will review it. In my first review, I will look at the `Files changed` and 
add a comment. You should receive a notification (See your [Settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications)) 
by email that I have commented. Return to the conversation via the email link provided or by navigating to the `Pull requests` tab on this 
repo. Read my comments and respond. Make sure to `Resolve conversation` to any and all comments that you have addressed.

5. (5 pts) Once you have responded to my comment, I will again review your Pull request. This time, I will ask for specific 
changes. Return to the conversation via the email link provided or by navigating to the `Pull requests` tab on this 
repo. Read my comments and note what specific changes need to be made. Make the changes by editing this file ([README.md](README.md)) 
Navigate to this file from the `Code` tab and edit it directly, then respond in the *Pull Request Conversation* that you have
made the requested changes. Make sure to `Resolve conversation` to any and all comments that you have addressed.

After you have made the commits to the branch and resolved the conversations I will approve the Pull request and that will complete the assignment.
